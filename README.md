## Conclusion & Recommendation

The data indicates a positive global growth rate of +8.46% in church attendance. While Nigerian branches reported higher attendee numbers, the combined growth rate of other countries surpassed that of Nigeria.

However, there are significant limitations and gaps in the data, making it challenging to provide concrete recommendations for further growth. Key issues include:

#### Incomplete Attendance Data:

  -	The data only covers Monday and Tuesday services, omitting Sunday, which is traditionally the most attended day for church services. Including Sunday data would provide a more accurate picture of overall attendance and engagement.

#### Age Group Analysis:

  -	The adult category lacks specific age ranges, hindering targeted strategic decisions. Detailed age data within the adult category would enable more precise demographic targeting and program planning.

#### Gender Gap Ratio:

  -	The provided data primarily covers Monday and Tuesday services. Understanding the type of programs conducted on these days could offer insights into the gender attendance disparity. More context on the nature of these services is necessary to address and bridge the gender gap effectively.

**To make well-informed decisions and develop strategies for increasing church attendance, it is essential to address these data limitations. Comprehensive data collection, including all service days and detailed demographic information, is crucial for accurate analysis and strategic planning.**
